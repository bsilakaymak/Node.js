<p>In this module you'll submit your homework only using GIT and GitHub.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js">GitHub</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-github-homework-guide">1. GitHub homework guide</h2>
<p>Follow the walkthrough to learn how to submit your homework for each week:</p>
<p>ONE TIME ONLY (START OF EVERY MODULE)</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo">fork</a> of the teacher's forked repository (ask in Slack what the URL for it is). You do this by using the <code>fork</code> option on the top right</li>
<li>Navigate to the URL of the cloned repository (it should be in your personal GitHub account, under "repositories")</li>
<li>Clone the repository, using SSH, to your local machine. You can do this by typing in <code>git clone &lt;git url&gt;</code> in the command line</li>
<li>On your local machine, navigate to the folder using the command line</li>
<li>Make sure you've cloned it correctly by running <code>git status</code> from the command line.</li>
</ol>
<p>EVERY WEEK</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new branch for each week you have homework. For example, for the week 1 homework for JavaScript2 create a branch called <code>week-1-homework-YOUR_NAME</code></li>
<li>Inside the correct week folder, create another folder called <code>homework</code>. Make your homework files in there, while on the correct branch</li>
<li>Once you're finished, add and commit everything. Make the commit message meaningful, for example <code>finished project for homework week1</code></li>
<li>Push the branch to your forked repository</li>
<li>On the GitHub page of your forked repository, click on the <code>create pull request</code> button. Make sure the <code>base repository</code> is your teacher's repository, on branch master</li>
<li>Give the pull request a title in the following format:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>markdown
Homework week 1 &lt;Your name&gt;</code></p>
<ol>
<li>Submit the pull request from your forked repository branch into the <code>master</code> branch</li>
<li>Do a little victory dance because you did it! Good job!</li>
</ol>
